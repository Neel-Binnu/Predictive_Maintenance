About Dataset
🛢️ Predictive Maintenance for Oil & Gas Pipelines – 1000
📌 Dataset Overview
This dataset contains 1,000 samples of pipeline data collected from the oil and gas industry, intended for use in predictive maintenance modeling. Each record represents sensor and operational data from pipelines, with corresponding labels indicating whether maintenance was required.

The goal is to develop models that can predict potential failures or maintenance needs before they occur, ensuring pipeline safety, reducing downtime, and minimizing operational costs.

🧾 Data Features
Each row in the dataset corresponds to a specific pipeline segment or instance and includes the following:

Pipe Size: Diameter of the pipeline

Thickness: Measured wall thickness of the pipe

Material: Type of material used (e.g., steel, composite)

Maximum Pressure: Peak pressure experienced (psi)

Temperature: Internal fluid temperature (°C)

Corrosion Impact Percentage: Estimated corrosion level (%)

**Thickness Loss: **Loss of wall thickness due to wear or corrosion

Material Loss Percentage: Percentage of overall material loss

Year Times: Age or time in service (years)

**Conditions: **Operational condition category (Normal, Moderate, Critical)

Maintenance_Required (Target): Binary label (1 = maintenance needed, 0 = no maintenance)

⚠️ This is synthetic data generated to reflect realistic conditions in oil and gas operations. It is suitable for training and testing machine learning models for predictive maintenance purposes.
